The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components: (1) The legal entity identifier of the third-party service provider; and (2) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the thirdparty service provider, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that third-party service provider. (h) Cross-jurisdictional swaps. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, if a swap is also reportable to one or more other jurisdictions with a regulatory reporting deadline earlier than the deadline set forth in § 45.3 or in part 43 of this chapter, the same unique transaction identifier generated according to the rules of the jurisdiction with the earliest regulatory reporting deadline shall be transmitted pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section and used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part. (a) Definitions. As used in this section: 17 CFR Part 45 (up to date as of 8/22/2024) Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 17 CFR 45.5(e)(2) 17 CFR 45.6(a) (enhanced display) page 11 of 51 Local operating unit means an entity authorized under the standards of the Global Legal Entity Identifier System to issue legal entity identifiers. Reference data means all identification and relationship information, as set forth in the standards of the Global Legal Entity Identifier System, of the legal entity or individual to which a legal entity identifier is assigned. Self-registration means submission by a legal entity or individual of its own reference data. Third-party registration means submission of reference data for a legal entity or individual that is or may become a swap counterparty, made by an entity or organization other than the legal entity or individual identified by the submitted reference data. Examples of third-party registration include, without limitation, submission by a swap dealer or major swap participant of reference data for its swap counterparties, and submission by a national numbering agency, national registration agency, or data service provider of reference data concerning legal entities or individuals with respect to which the agency or service provider maintains information. (b) International standard for the legal entity identifier. The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part shall be issued under, and shall conform to, ISO Standard 17442, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), issued by the International Organization for Standardization. (c) Reference data reporting. Reference data for each swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap data repository, entity reporting pursuant to § 45.9, and counterparty to any swap shall be reported, by self-registration, third-party registration, or both, to a local operating unit in accordance with the standards set by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System. All subsequent changes and corrections to reference data previously reported shall be reported, by selfregistration, third-party registration, or both, to a local operating unit as soon as technologically practicable following occurrence of any such change or discovery of the need for a correction. (d) Use of the legal entity identifier. (1) Each swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap data repository, entity reporting pursuant to § 45.9, and swap counterparty shall use legal entity identifiers to identify itself and swap counterparties in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part. If a swap counterparty is not eligible to receive a legal entity identifier as determined by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System, such counterparty shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part with an alternate identifier as prescribed by the Commission pursuant to § 45.13(a) of this chapter. (2) Each swap dealer, major swap participant, swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, and swap data repository shall maintain and renew its legal identity identifier in accordance with the standards set by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System. (3) Each financial entity reporting counterparty executing a swap with a counterparty that is eligible to receive a legal entity identifier, but has not been assigned a legal entity identifier, shall, prior to reporting any required swap creation data for such swap, use best efforts to cause a legal entity identifier to be assigned to the counterparty. If these efforts do not result in a legal entity identifier being assigned to the counterparty prior to the reporting of required swap creation data, the financial entity reporting counterparty shall promptly provide the identity and contact information of the counterparty to the Commission. 17 CFR Part 45 (up to date as of 8/22/2024) Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 17 CFR 45.6(a) “Local operating unit” 17 CFR 45.6(d)(3) (enhanced display) page 12 of 51 [85 FR 75563, Nov. 25, 2020] § 45.7 Unique product identifiers. Each swap shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by means of a unique product identifier and product classification system as specified in this section. Each swap sufficiently standardized to receive a unique product identifier shall be identified by a unique product identifier. Each swap not sufficiently standardized for this purpose shall be identified by its description using the product classification system. (4) For swaps previously reported pursuant to this part using substitute counterparty identifiers assigned by a swap data repository prior to Commission designation of a legal entity identifier system, each swap data repository shall map the legal entity identifiers for the counterparties to the substitute counterparty identifiers in the record for each such swap. (a) Requirements for the unique product identifier and product classification system. The unique product identifier and product classification system shall identify and describe the swap asset class and the subtype within that asset class to which the swap belongs, and the underlying product for the swap, with sufficient distinctiveness and specificity to enable the Commission and other financial regulators to fulfill their regulatory responsibilities and to assist in real time reporting of swaps as provided in the Act and part 43 of this chapter. The level of distinctiveness and specificity which the unique product identifier will provide shall be determined separately for each swap asset class. (b) Designation of the unique product identifier and product classification system. (1) The Commission shall determine when a unique product identifier and product classification system that is acceptable to the Commission and satisfies the requirements set forth in this section is available for use in compliance with this section. (2) When the Commission determines that such a unique product identifier and product classification system is available, the Commission shall designate the unique product identifier and product classification system to be used in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, by means of a Commission order that is published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of this designation, the contact information of the issuer of such unique product identifiers, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for obtaining unique product identifiers and using the product classification system. (c) Use of the unique product identifier and product classification system by registered entities and swap counterparties. (1) When a unique product identifier and product classification system has been designated by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the unique product identifier and product classification system in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part. (2) Before a unique product identifier and product classification system has been designated by the Commission, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the internal product identifier or product description used by the swap data repository to which a swap is reported in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part. 17 CFR Part 45 (up to date as of 8/22/2024) Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 17 CFR 45.6(d)(4) 17 CFR 45.7(c)(2) (enhanced display) page 13 of 51 [77 FR 2197, Jan. 13, 2012, as amended at 85 FR 75563, Nov. 25, 2020] § 45.8 Determination of which counterparty shall report. The determination of which counterparty is the reporting counterparty for each swap shall be made as provided in this section. (a) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty. (b) If neither counterparty is a swap dealer, and only one counterparty is a major swap participant, the major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty. (c) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties, and only one counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparty that is a financial entity shall be the reporting counterparty. (d) If both counterparties are swap dealers, or both counterparties are major swap participants, or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties that are financial entities as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties and neither counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C): (1) For a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the counterparties shall agree which counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty. (2) For an off-facility swap, the counterparties shall agree as one term of their swap which counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty. (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, if both counterparties to a swap are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties and only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty. (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if neither counterparty to a swap is a U.S. person, but the swap is executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market or otherwise executed in the United States, or is cleared by a derivatives clearing organization: (1) For such a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the counterparties shall agree which counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty. (2) For an off-facility swap, the counterparties shall agree as one term of their swap which counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty. (g) If a reporting counterparty selected pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section ceases to be a counterparty to a swap due to an assignment or novation, the reporting counterparty for reporting of required swap continuation data following the assignment or novation shall be selected from the two current counterparties as provided in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section. (1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations. (2) If neither counterparty is a swap dealer, and only one counterparty is a major swap participant, the major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations. 17 CFR Part 45 (up to date as of 8/22/2024) Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 17 CFR 45.8 17 CFR 45.8(g)(2) (enhanced display) page 14 of 51 (3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties, and only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations. (4) In all other cases, the counterparty that replaced the previous reporting counterparty by reason of the assignment or novation shall be the reporting counterparty, unless otherwise agreed by the counterparties. (h) For all swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the rules of the swap execution facility or designated contract market must require each swap counterparty to provide sufficient information to the swap execution facility or designated contract market to enable the swap execution facility or designated contract market to report all required swap creation data as provided in this part. (1) To comply with paragraph (h) of this section, the rules of the swap execution facility or designated contract market must require each market participant placing an order with respect to any swap traded on the swap execution facility or designated contract market to include in the order, without limitation: (i) The legal entity identifier of the market participant placing the order. (ii) A yes/no indication of whether the market participant is a swap dealer with respect to the product with respect to which the order is placed. (iii) A yes/no indication of whether the market participant is a major swap participant with respect to the product with respect to which the order is placed. (iv) A yes/no indication of whether the market participant is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C). (v) A yes/no indication of whether the market participant is a U.S. person. (vi) If applicable, an indication that the market participant will elect an exception to, or an exemption from, the clearing requirement under part 50 of this chapter for any swap resulting from the order. (vii) If the swap will be allocated: (A) An indication that the swap will be allocated. (B) The legal entity identifier of the agent. (C) An indication of whether the swap is a post-allocation swap. (D) If the swap is a post-allocation swap, the unique transaction identifier of the initial swap transaction between the reporting counterparty and the agent. (2) To comply with paragraph (h) of this section, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must use the information obtained pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section to identify the counterparty that is the reporting counterparty pursuant to the CEA and this section. (i) Clearing swaps. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, if the swap is a clearing swap, the derivatives clearing organization that is a counterparty to such swap shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all reporting counterparty obligations for such swap.\n",
